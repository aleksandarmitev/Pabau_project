# Pabaufinal



  To built this React application i needed to integrate Apollo Client. I must confess that it was my first time working with Apollo Client and i'm sorry that i didn't have more time to be able to work more on this app due to limited time and some other personal issues. 
I managed by myself to implement Apollo Client and to show past missions on landing page on my react app.I used newest version of bootstrap and css.

  My main project is in folder "pabaufinal", and to succesfully install and run on vs code, it needs to open new terminal from vs code and to write commands "npm install" and then "npm start". Versions to succesfully run this project for apollo client and  graphql are "@apollo/client": "^3.4.17","graphql": "^15.7.2"
The second task from this assigment is not fully done, it lacks to show the different information about rockets from certain missions but i managed via modal message box to show some information about rocket Falcon 9.

If you have some tips and tricks how to resolve this task or what's the correct way to solve it i would be more than happy to hear from you.
